/* ── TWO CAMERAS, ONE AT A TIME ──────────────────────────────────────
   A PICKED PLOT: the map CONTAINER is CSS-transformed by camRef, which
   is what puts the raised block, its walls, the scrim and the plan in
   one space that turns together.

   THE UNPICKED MAP: Google's own camera turns instead — real heading
   and tilt — so the imagery goes round a full 360° with the plan riding
   on it, and because nothing is CSS-transformed the container needs no
   oversizing and there is no padding at all in that state.

   They must never both be off square at once, or the block would lean
   by the sum. flyTo unwinds the native camera to north and flat across
   the flight in, so the CSS camera takes over from square.

   THE NATIVE HALF NEEDS A VECTOR MAP: GOOGLE_MAP_STYLE_ID must be a Map
   ID whose style is Vector. On raster, heading and tilt are accepted
   and ignored — the two-finger turn below will do nothing, AND THE
   OPENING ORBIT WILL SIT DEAD STILL, though a picked plot still behaves
   exactly as before. If the 360 is dead on every device, check the Map
   ID before reading another line of this. */

/* ── THE OPENING ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
   IT OPENS FLAT AND NORTH-UP, and stays that way until a hand moves
   it. That is the frame the drawing was made for: plot numbers upright,
   both axes at true scale, roads reading as roads, the whole layout on
   screen. A lean looks impressive and costs the customer the one view
   they can actually read the site from — so the tilt, like the turn, is
   theirs to ask for.

   Nothing here levels the camera behind them afterwards either. Lean it
   and it stays leaned; the only things that flatten it are the compass
   and the toolbar's fit button.

   THE OPENING MOVE IS OFF, and these are what turn it back on:

     INTRO_LEAN   true and the camera eases over to INTRO_TILT_DEG once
                  the fit has landed, instead of holding flat.
     INTRO_LAPS   0 = hands only · 1 = one lap then stop · Infinity =
                  it keeps turning until someone touches the map.
                  Needs INTRO_LEAN, since the lap follows the lean.

   THE TILT IS EASED IN, NOT SET. Leaning the camera over in one frame
   is the same glitch as a step change in zoom: the imagery re-projects
   in a single tick and the plan appears to snap. INTRO_MS is the lean.

   INTRO_PULL is how far the camera backs off, in zoom levels, while it
   leans. A tilted camera crops the near edge of the frame — the fit was
   computed square — so without this the nearest plots slide off the
   bottom the moment the view leans. 0.35 covers a 45° lean on a phone.

   SPIN_TAU_MS is how quickly a lap gets up to speed, and how quickly it
   gives way when a hand lands on the glass: an exponential approach
   rather than a switch, so it fades in and out instead of starting and
   stopping. About 3× tau to settle, so ~2.7s either way.

   Any of it is abandoned the moment anyone touches the map, and none of
   it runs for someone who has asked for reduced motion. */

/* The close-up.

   GUTTER is clear ground kept around the plot for the dimension
   figures, in METRES — those stand off the edge by a fixed ground
   distance whatever the plot's size, so a small plot needs a bigger
   share of the screen than a big one, and a percentage would get it
   wrong at both ends. Too low and DimensionOverlay's figures clip.

   IT IS TIED TO SCALE IN DimensionOverlay. That file's `off + txt` is
   how far the outermost figure reaches past the plot; this must cover
   it. At SCALE 1.35 that is about 1.5 m, hence 1.6. Raise SCALE without
   raising this and the figures are framed off the edge of the screen —
   which looks like the close-up being too tight, and is not.

   LIFT_RESERVE is the fraction of the raised block's screen reach that
   the fit sets aside — of the reach AT THE CURRENT TILT, not at
   MAX_TILT. The block only reaches its full height when the view is
   tilted right over, and a pick lands on a flat camera, so reserving
   the full-tilt reach was what left the plot small and floating with
   empty ground above and below. Worst on a phone, where there is no
   spare screen to absorb it.

   CLOSE_BOOST then pushes in past the fit. 1.0 is the fit itself: plot
   plus gutter exactly filling the frame. Higher fills more screen at
   the cost of the outermost figures sitting nearer the edges. Small
   screens get more of it, because the chrome over them claims a bigger
   share of a smaller frame. This is the knob to turn if a pick is not
   close enough; leave the fit maths alone.

   SLACK keeps the drawing off the glass.

   LIFT_BIAS sits the plot low by that fraction of the reserved reach so
   the RAISED block finishes centred instead of crowding the top edge.

   FLY_MIN_Z is a floor, not a target — it exists so a huge plot cannot
   pull the camera out to nothing. FLY_MAX_Z must not exceed MAP_MAX_Z
   or the fit is silently clamped and small plots stop getting closer.
   Past about 21 the satellite imagery has no more detail and Google
   upscales it: the overlay and its dimensions stay sharp, the photo
   behind them goes soft. */

/* ── THE DIMENSION FIGURES ────────────────────────────────────────
   Drawn in SCREEN space, not on the ground.

   DimensionOverlay draws them into the lift sheet, in drawing metres,
   which means they live on the ground plane and inherit the camera:
   tilt the view to look at the raised block and the figures are
   squashed by cos(tilt), skewed by the spin, and — because the sheet is
   rasterised once at the window's pixel size — softened as well. That
   is the tiny illegible text on the edges of plot 9, and no amount of
   zooming fixes it, because everything grows together.

   These are placed on the plot's edges but rendered upright at a FIXED
   pixel size, by counter-transforming each label against the camera. A
   12 pt figure stays a 12 pt figure at every tilt, heading and zoom.

   OFF BY DEFAULT, and it should stay off unless you have a reason.
   DimensionOverlay knows things this layer does not: it walks fillet
   RUNS rather than raw edges, so a rounded corner gets one figure for
   the whole arc instead of one per tiny segment; it draws the extension
   lines and end ticks that make a figure a dimension rather than a
   number floating near an edge; and it carries the plot's name and area
   in the middle. Turning this on throws all of that away in exchange
   for type that does not foreshorten.

 * Map + plan. The map owns pan and zoom; the plan is one div riding an

 *
 * The map instance is kept in BOTH a ref (for the parent, and for the
 * event handlers that must not re-bind) and in state. The state copy is
 * what tells the overlay hook the map exists: a ref assignment does not
 * re-render, so without it the overlay is built on the one render where
 * mapRef.current is still null and never gets built again.
 *
 * SELECTED is what the user has chosen; SHOWN is what is currently
 * standing up. They differ for the length of a swap: the old plot has to
 * finish sinking before the new one is allowed to rise, or the block
 * appears to teleport across the layout.
 *
 * IT OPENS FLAT. The layout is fitted north-up and held there; tilting
 * and turning are the user's, by hand or by the compass. Nothing levels
 * the camera again afterwards — see INTRO_LEAN and fitPlan's
 * keepCamera.
 *
 * WITH A PLOT RAISED the whole surface orbits on a plain drag, turning
 * the map CONTAINER, which has two consequences, both handled below:
 * the container has to be bigger than the viewport or its corners swing
 * into view, and Google's own pointer maths doesn't know about the
 * transform — so dragging and wheel zoom are taken over for the
 * duration.
 *
 * WITH NOTHING RAISED the map's own camera turns instead: two fingers
 * on touch, drag on a desktop. Full 360° at any zoom, and no container
 * oversizing, so no padding.
 *
 * NOTHING IN THE HOT PATH CALLS setState. A turn, a rise and a flight
 * all run through overlayRef.draw() and direct DOM writes; React is
 * only re-rendered when the gesture ends or the drawing window actually
 * moves. That is what keeps the animation smooth — a setState per frame
 * was the flicker. The compass follows the same rule.
 *
 * A pick FLIES the camera in — see flyTo. The OPENING view is a fit to
 * the PLOTS — see fitPlan. Not a fixed zoom, which frames a laptop and
 * crops a phone, and not the drawing's own bounds, which include margin
 * the customer did not come to see.
 *
 * FILTERS live here rather than in App because everything they need —
 * the layout, and the match set the plan is already drawn against — is
 * here. The panel narrows on top of whatever `matches` the parent sends

  /* ── THE STATUS VIEW: ON IN THE APP, GONE ON A SHARED LINK ────────
     Sale colours, the legend that explains them and the switch that
     turns them off are ONE decision, taken here, and every one of the
     three reads it. No route has to be told what kind of route it is,
     and there is no shareView flag to keep in step with three other
     files.

     WHICH ROUTE THIS IS, ASKED TWO WAYS. `share` is the deliberate
     answer; isShareUrl() is the backstop, because `share` has to be
     threaded through every wrapper between the route and this component
     and a prop dropped in that chain fails silently toward showing the
     colours — in front of exactly the customer who should not see them.
     Either one being true is enough. See SHARE_PATH at the top of the
     file, and match it to your own public route.

     ON BY DEFAULT IN THE APP, and the test is written so that only a
     DELIBERATE false turns it off. `setShowStatus ? showStatus : ...`
     used to read the prop bare, so a parent that owns the flag but has
     not set it on the first render — undefined, not false — got the
     colours switched off in the app as well, which is the bug that had
     status missing on the routes that had asked for it. `showStatus
     !== false` keeps undefined on the ON side of the line.

     ownStatus seeds at plain `true` rather than at `showStatus !==
     false` for the same reason: on a route that passes no status props
     at all, seeding local state off a missing prop is a coin toss.

     Sold / booked / available is the first thing anyone opening a
     layout looks for, so it should never be a view someone has to go
     and find a switch for. The white master-plan tone is not replaced
     by it either — PlanContent only reaches for a status colour when a
     plot actually HAS a status, so an unsold plot, or one Firestore has
     not mapped yet, still draws in the plain drawing tone.

     NOTE what is NOT in this test: `status` itself. A version reading
     `!share && !status` blinks the colours off for the first frames of
     every load, while the status map is still coming down from
     Firestore. */

     Framing a pick — the close-up.

     Picking a plot brings it to you rather than leaving you to go find
     it, and closes in until the plot fills the frame with its dimension
     figures legible around it. Centre is the plot's bounding box, not
     its centroid: an L-shaped plot's centroid can sit outside the plot,
     and the box is what actually has to fit on screen.

     The camera turns the CONTAINER about its own centre, and the
     container is padded symmetrically around the viewport, so the map
     centre and the viewport centre are the same point at every heading.
     That is why this can be a plain setCenter and doesn't have to undo
     the spin.

     Zoom is a real fit, then a deliberate push past it. What has to be
     on screen is the plot's box PLUS the gutter its figures live in;
     the axes are fitted separately rather than to the short side, which
     is what lets a wide plot fill the width instead of being framed for
     a height it doesn't have.

     THE TILT IS READ, NOT ASSUMED. Both vertical corrections — the
     cos(tilt) squash and the raised block's reach — are computed at the
     camera's CURRENT tilt, every time, by pickFrame below. A pick lands
     on a flat camera, where both are zero, so the plot fills the frame
     instead of being framed for headroom nothing is using. Tilt the
     view afterwards and refitPick closes the difference, so the plot
     keeps filling the frame instead of shrinking toward the horizon.

     Only ever draw the part of the plan you can actually see, at the

     transform's scale stays at 1.0 forever and every glyph is rendered
     at its final size. Fewer plots per frame, too. The window is padded
     well past the edges so ordinary panning doesn't touch it.

     This copes with a natively rotated map without being told about it:
     the four window corners are projected one by one and quadMatrix
     takes whatever quadrilateral comes back, turned or not. That is

         It used to be the bounding box of the four projected corners,

  /* ── TURNING THE MAP, FROM ANYWHERE, ON ANY DEVICE ───────────────
     The turn, the tilt and the zoom of the UNPICKED map, listened for
     on the DOCUMENT in the capture phase — touch and mouse both.

     It used to hang off the map's own element, which meant BOTH fingers
     had to land on bare map. On a phone the logo header, the filter
     button, the legend and the toggles cover a good part of the screen,
     so half the twists people actually make started on one of those and
     did nothing at all — "rotation kabhi chalta hai, kabhi nahi". The
     capture phase sees every touch on the way DOWN, before any of that
     chrome can take it, so a two-finger gesture ANYWHERE turns the map
     while one-finger taps on those controls keep working untouched.

     All three axes come off the one gesture: the twist between the
     fingers is the heading, sliding them up and down together is the
     tilt, spreading them is the zoom. Computed here rather than left to
     Google, whose own two-finger handling differs by platform and gives
     no tilt below certain zooms — which is the other half of why this
     behaved differently on every device.

     One finger still pans, which is what anyone expects of a map.

     MOUSE: a plain left drag turns and tilts, from anywhere over the
     map — including over the header and the panels, for the same
     reason. Drags that start on something interactive are left alone,
     or a button press would swing the camera. That INTERACTIVE list is
     what keeps the compass and the site rail clickable.

     `touchmove` is cancelled non-passive for the length of a
     two-finger gesture, and Safari's own gesturestart/gesturechange
     with it, or the browser zooms the page instead.

     NONE OF IT WORKS ON A RASTER MAP. If a device somewhere refuses to
     turn, that device fell back off the vector renderer — turn on
     CAMERA_DEBUG and the console will say so. */
